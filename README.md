# Assignment2  
### This is my second assignment

In this assignment I learned about _HTML tags and HTML form elements_, some of them were **quite new** for me.

In this assignment, I created 4 html pages:

* index.html
* aboutus.html
* solutions.html
* contactus.html

> Overall, I enjoyed doing a quiz and making html pages
